Ethical AI Use in Healthcare: Guiding Principles

1. Patient Consent Protocols
- Informed Consent: Patients must receive clear, non-technical explanations of how AI systems will be used in their care, what data will be processed, and possible outcomes.
- Opt-In Policy: Participation in AI-assisted healthcare should be voluntary, with patients explicitly opting in after understanding implications.
- Consent Renewal: For ongoing or evolving systems, consent should be periodically reaffirmed, especially when AI capabilities or data usage changes.
- Data Control: Patients should retain rights to access, correct, or request deletion of their data as per privacy regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.

2.  Bias Mitigation Strategies
- Diverse Data Collection: Ensure datasets used for training AI include varied populations across ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, and geography.
- Bias Audits: Conduct regular internal and external audits to identify and reduce disparities in model performance and outcomes.
- Human-in-the-Loop: Maintain oversight by qualified healthcare professionals to catch AI-driven recommendations that might reflect or reinforce bias.
- Equity by Design: Incorporate fairness objectives during system designâ€”prioritize equitable access and reduce harm to vulnerable groups.

3. Transparency Requirements
- Explainability: Provide interpretable outputs where AI decisions can be understood by both clinicians and patients to support shared decision-making.
- System Disclosure: Identify when an AI system is being used in diagnosis, treatment, or patient monitoring, and disclose its role and limitations.
- Documentation & Traceability: Maintain clear logs of AI system actions, input data sources, model versions, and decision rationales for accountability.
- Public Reporting: Share performance metrics, limitations, and incidents of harm or failure in public or peer-reviewed formats to build trust.
