Working on this assignment as the group leader gave me a full-circle view of how an AI project is developed — not just technically, but through real collaboration and planning. The most challenging part was managing everyone's workload fairly while making sure every section of the assignment was completed on time and at a high standard. Coordinating different writing styles, technical strengths, and schedules required clear communication and flexibility.

If we had more time and resources, I would’ve loved for us to go deeper into the technical implementation. For example, actually training a model using sample data and visualizing the evaluation metrics like the confusion matrix through Python. I also think building a basic dashboard to simulate how the model would integrate into a real hospital system would’ve been a valuable experience.

Despite the challenges, this task taught us how important planning, ethical considerations, and real-world constraints are in any AI project — especially in sensitive fields like healthcare.
